## Mintaka-50:

the smallest keyboard of my three-board-series named after the three bright stars forming the omnipresent orion belt you can perceive within the night. 

This keyboard was heavily inspired by _The Liminal_ by _The_Royal_ found [here]((https://theroyalprojectscom.wordpress.com/portfolio-2/liminal/)) and was originally planned as drop-in replacement for the actual keyboard. Due to Layout issues, I dropped the plan and went with a new Design. Because the amount of columns and rows is rather small, I went with the cheap and easily available Atmega32u2.
